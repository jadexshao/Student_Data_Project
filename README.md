    "Having worked at a classroom learning/management platform edtech startup, I was inspired to do this project as a way to learn more about the process of building a data-driven student intervention system as well as to understand how data science can be used to transform education. As a passionate advocate of technology in education, I wanted to really explore the bridge between the two spheres and experience the result of their interation.\n",

    "The dataset below was provided by Kaggle, and gives a snapshot of student engagement and student background as well as their corresponding final grades (classified by 3 categories: high-level grades, middle-levelgrades, & low-level grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to determine which factors are the greatest indicators in identifying a student as being at‚Äêrisk either behaviorally or academically and to make predictions, based on these factors, of which students belong to which grade class (high, middle or low). \n",
